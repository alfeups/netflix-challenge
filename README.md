## Recreating NETFLIX page.

<p>This repository is part of the challenge proposed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/digitalinnovation-one/">Digital Innovation One</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-aguiar-047/">Felipe Aguiar.</a><p>

<p>First of all, the page design based on Netflix original page. Secondly, it was created the header, a wrapper or container to store the main film. After that, a Owl Carousel was picked and added to the project, as you can see in the image below.<p>

Once the "skeletal aspects" of the page was created, it was time for customize the functions. How the images should be shown, transictions, image sizes, buttons, hover, all those fantanstics mechanisms. However, in this particular point I've faced some difficults, the main of them was to make the figure in the center of the carousel bigger than the other. So I'd say that it isn't the final version, actually, there's no final version of that. :joy: 

Summing up this experience, I would like to say thank you to The Digital Innovation One as well as to our tutor, who was very didactical and straight to the point. As I am cutting my teeth as a coder, this experience was really something thinking about improve my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JS skills and I also learned about a new tool - at least for me - Owl Carousel.
